        <h2>About the NBA</h2>
        <div id="about-container">
            <p>The <span id="nba">National Basketball Association</span> (NBA) is the world's premier professional
                basketball league and one
                of
                the most popular sports leagues globally. Founded on June 6, 1946, in New York City as the Basketball
                Association of America (BAA), it merged with the rival National Basketball League in 1949 and officially
                became the NBA. Today it stands as a cultural and commercial powerhouse, blending elite athletic
                competition
                with entertainment, fashion, music, and global influence.
                <br><br>
                The league consists of <a id="page-redirect" href="./pages/teams.html">30 teams</a>: 29 in the
                <em>United States</em> and
                one in <em>Canada</em> (the
                Toronto Raptors). These
                teams are split evenly into the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, with each conference
                containing
                three divisions of five teams. Every team plays an 82-game regular season from mid-October to mid-April,
                followed by a 16-team playoff tournament that ends with the NBA Finals in June, where the champion is
                crowned in a best-of-seven series.
                <br><br>
                The NBA is renowned for its superstar-driven style of play, spectacular athleticism, and global reach.
                Legends like <a id="page-redirect" href="./pages/players.html">Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, LeBron
                    James</a>, and current
                stars such as Stephen Curry, Nikola
                Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Victor Wembanyama have made the league a worldwide phenomenon. The
                Boston
                Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers are tied for the most championships with 17 each. Alongside the NFL, MLB,
                and
                NHL, the NBA is one of North America's four major professional sports leagues and continues to grow in
                popularity around the world.
